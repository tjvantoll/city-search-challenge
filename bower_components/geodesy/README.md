geodesy
=======

Libraries of geodesy functions implemented in JavaScript – intended to serve as examples or
starting-points for people wanting to develop geodesy applications (in JavaScript or other languages),
though they can also be used as-is.

latlon.js
---------

This is a library of geodesy functions for working with points and paths on (a spherical model of)
the earth’s surface, including (orthodromic) great-circle geodesics and (loxodromic) rhumb lines.
All calculations are done using spherical trigonometry.

The library includes the following functions:

- `distanceTo` destination point (using haversine formulation)
- `bearingTo` destination point
- `finalBearingTo` destination point
- `midpointTo` destination point
- `destinationPoint` following initial bearing for given distance
- `intersection` of two paths
- `rhumbDistanceTo` destination point
- `rhumbBearingTo` destination point
- `rhumbDestinationPoint` following given bearing for given distance
- `rhumbMidpointTo` destination point

Full details are available at www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html.

latlon-vincenty.js
------------------

Vincenty’s formulae for ‘direct and inverse solutions of geodesics on the ellipsoid’;
these give distances and bearings on an ellipsoidal earth model accurate to within 0.5mm distance,
0.000015″ bearing.

The library includes the following wrapper functions:

- `distanceTo` destination point
- `initialBearingTo` destination point
- `finalBearingTo` destination point
- `destinationPoint` following initial bearing for given distance
- `finalBearingOn` initial bearing for given distance

The heaving lifting is done in two routines:

- `direct` (implementing the direct solution of geodesics on the ellipsoid)
- `inverse` (implementing the inverse solution of geodesics on the ellipsoid)

Full details are available at www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong-vincenty.html.

latlon-ellipsoid.js
-------------------

Geodesy tools for an ellipsoidal earth model.

The `LatLonE` object incorporates not just latitude & longitude coordinates, but also the datum the
lat/lon point is defined on.

`LatLonE` also holds ellipsoid parameters and Helmert transform parameters for translating between
different datums (e.g. between OSGB36 & WGS-84).

The `convertDatum` function performs such translations between datums.

The library includes:

- `ellipsoid` parameters
- `datum` parameters (reference ellipsoid & Helmert transform parameters)
- `convertDatum`: convert lat/lon point to new datum
- `toCartesian`: convert lat/lon point to ECEF 3-d vector
- `toLatLon`: convert ECEF 3-d vector to lat/lon point

latlon-vectors.js
-----------------

This is a library of functions for working with points and paths on (a spherical model of) the
earth’s surface using a vector-based approach using ‘n-vectors’ (rather than the more common
spherical trigonometry; a vector-based approach makes most calculations much simpler, and easier to
follow, compared with trigonometric equivalents).

The library includes:

- `distanceTo` destination point
- `bearingTo` destination point
- `midpointTo` destination point
- `destinationPoint` following initial bearing for given distance
- `intersection` of two paths
- `crossTrackDistanceTo` great circle path
- `enclosedBy` polygon
- `meanOf` set of points

osgridref.js
------------

Routines for converting between Ordnance Survey grid references and (OSGB-36) latitude/longitude
coordinates, based on Ordnance Survey formulae.

The library includes:

- `latLonToOsGrid`: convert (OSGB) latitude/longitude to (numeric) OS grid reference
- `osGridToLatLon`: convert (numeric) OS grid reference to (OSGB) latitude/longitude
- `parse` standard format grid reference to numeric grid reference
- `toString`: convert numeric grid reference to standard format

utm.js, mgrs.js
---------------

Routines for converting between UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) coordinates and latitude/longitude 
coordinates (WGS84 or any other ellipsoid datum), and between UTM and MGRS (Military Grid Reference 
System) grid references. Based on Karney 2011 ‘Transverse Mercator with an accuracy of a few nanometers’.

The libraries include:

- `LatLonE.toUtm`: convert (WGS84) latitude/longitude to UTM coordinate
- `Utm.toLatLon`: convert UTM coordinate to (WGS84) latitude/longitude
- `Utm.toMgrs` convert UTM coordinate to MGRS grid reference (including Norway and Svalbard exceptions)
- `Mgrs.toUtm`: convert MGRS grid reference to UTM coordinate

More information at www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong-utm-mgrs.html.

geo.js
------

Tools for converting between numeric degrees and degrees / minutes / seconds.

The library includes the following functions:

- `parseDMS`: parse string representing degrees/minutes/seconds into numeric degrees
- `toLat`: convert decimal degrees to latitude
- `toLon`: convert decimal degrees to longitude
- `toBrng`: convert decimal degrees to bearing

geohash.js
----------

Geohash is now moved to [its own repository](https://github.com/chrisveness/latlon-geohash), as this
one is becoming bloated.

Documentation
-------------

Documentation for all these methods is available at www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/js/geodesy/docs.
